Path Visualization Algorithms
This Python program provides a visualization tool for popular pathfinding algorithms: A* (A-star), Flood Fill, and BFS (Breadth-First Search). 
The program allows users to input a grid-based environment and observe how each algorithm navigates through the space to find a path from the start to the goal.

These algorithms are popularly applied for path finding in everyday navigations, path finding in robotics and contests.
This is based on the IEEE competition micromouse.
Problem Description: (abstract) Given a micromouse that has a goal and start how can we efficiently navigate the mouse from the start to end in the least time if exists.

Algorithm Descriptions
A* (A-star)
A* is a heuristic search algorithm that finds the shortest path from the start to the goal. It uses a combination of the cost to reach a node and a heuristic estimate of the cost from that node to the goal.

Flood Fill
Flood Fill is an algorithm for traversing and labeling connected components in a grid. It starts at the specified point and visits all connected points, marking them with the same label.

BFS (Breadth-First Search)
BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores all the vertices of the graph level by level, starting from the source.
